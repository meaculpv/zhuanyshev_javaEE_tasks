# Tasks from course of Java EE by Zhuanyshev Ilyas

I solved this tasks for myself to learn Java EE and I am sharing it with educational purpose for others.
I spent a bunch of time just trying to connect PostgreSQL JDBC to my web application, so I hope it will help others to not suffer like me.

* To solve these tasks were used Java EE, Bootstrap v5.3, PostgreSQL, Tomcat v10.1.5.
* The text of task is on the same named jsp pages except for the first task. It is on the index.jsp page.
